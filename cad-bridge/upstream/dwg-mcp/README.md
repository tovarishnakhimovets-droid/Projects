## Drawing Translation Should Not Stop At Manual Copy-Paste

Construction and engineering drawings carry dense technical text — specifications, notes, dimensions, material callouts, legends. When those drawings arrive in a foreign language, translation is not optional. It is required before the project team can act.

The usual workflow is painful: select text one entity at a time, copy to a translator, paste back, fix the font (because SHX fonts cannot render Vietnamese or CJK), adjust the height, hope nothing shifted. Multiply by hundreds of text fragments per sheet, dozens of sheets per project.

`dwg-mcp` exists to compress that loop into two steps: select the text, let the AI agent read, translate, and rewrite it in place — with correct font, correct height, correct spatial grouping, and a single undo.

---

## What dwg-mcp Is

`dwg-mcp` is a local MCP gateway for Autodesk AutoCAD 2022-2027 DWG workflows.

It has two parts:

- **Bimwright.Dwg.Server**: a .NET 8 MCP server launched by Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, or another stdio MCP client.
- **Bimwright.Dwg.Plugin**: version-specific AutoCAD add-in shells loaded inside AutoCAD, executing commands against the drawing database.

The agent talks MCP. The server talks to the plugin over a local wire: TCP NDJSON for AutoCAD 2022–2024, and a Named Pipe (loopback, avoids the firewall prompt) for 2025–2027. The plugin talks to the AutoCAD .NET API.

Everything stays on your machine.

---

## Why It Matters

AI agents make it possible to describe "translate all selected text to Vietnamese" and have it happen — correctly — in the drawing. But intent alone is not enough. AutoCAD text operations require understanding spatial layout, fragment grouping, font limitations, MText vs DBText, block references, and height scaling.

`dwg-mcp` handles that complexity:

- **Spatial clustering** groups fragmented text into logical sentences (by block, row, column, paragraph).
- **Automatic font handling** creates a Unicode-capable text style and applies it — no more SHX question marks.
- **Height scaling** compensates for the different visual density of Latin vs CJK text.
- **MText conversion** upgrades single-line fragments into multi-line text when safe.
- **Single undo** wraps each operation in a transaction.

## Install

Download the client setup ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bimwright/dwg-mcp/releases/latest). It includes a self-contained MCP server and the AutoCAD plugin years that were compiled for that release (see `manifest.json` inside the ZIP). This machine’s v1.0.0 ZIP ships **2024** and **2027**. Other years: build the plugin from source with that year’s AutoCAD SDK.

```powershell
$tag = (Invoke-RestMethod https://api.github.com/repos/bimwright/dwg-mcp/releases/latest).tag_name
$zip = "$env:TEMP\DwgMcp.Setup-$tag-win-x64.zip"
$dir = "$env:TEMP\DwgMcp.Setup-$tag-win-x64"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/bimwright/dwg-mcp/releases/download/$tag/DwgMcp.Setup-$tag-win-x64.zip" -OutFile $zip
Expand-Archive $zip -DestinationPath $dir -Force

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$dir\install.ps1" -WhatIf
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$dir\install.ps1"
```

The installer:

- detects installed AutoCAD years (a year counts when its `acad.exe` exists) and installs every packed year that matches; `-Years 2024,2027` forces an explicit list;
- requires AutoCAD to be closed, and rolls every change back on error;
- deploys `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Bimwright.Dwg.bundle\` (removing stale bundles with the same ProductCode) and the server at the fixed path `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\server\current\dwg-mcp.exe`;
- seeds `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\dwgmcp.config.json` with `"toolsets": ["all"]` on a fresh install — an existing `toolsets` key is kept;
- wires every detected MCP client by default (`-Client <names>` limits it, `-Client none` skips it); config edits keep JSONC comments and get a `<config>.bak` backup. The entry name is `dwg-mcp`.

Restart AutoCAD, then restart wired MCP clients to load `dwg-mcp`.

**Updating:** close AutoCAD and run the new ZIP's `install.ps1` the same way — no need to uninstall first. The server path stays `server\current\`, so clients only need a restart.

**Uninstall:** `uninstall.ps1` removes the bundle, the server copies, discovery files and caches under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\` (settings, config, logs and captures are kept; `-Purge` removes those too). Client config entries are never touched — remove the `dwg-mcp` entry yourself, or run `install.ps1 -Uninstall -Client <names>` first.

Do **not** `dotnet tool install -g Bimwright.Dwg.Server` — that package is not the supported client install.

**Developer (local SDK):** `dotnet build` the year you have, then `pwsh scripts/install.ps1 -Years 2024` from the repo (copies that year’s `bin` output). `NETLOAD` remains available for Debug DLLs.

### 3. Wire up your MCP client

The installer already did this for detected clients (Step `Client :` lines in its summary). To wire by hand, add to your MCP client config (e.g., `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dwg-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Bimwright\\Dwg\\server\\current\\dwg-mcp.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Pin a specific AutoCAD instance with a 4-digit target year:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dwg-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Bimwright\\Dwg\\server\\current\\dwg-mcp.exe",
      "args": ["--target", "2024"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use `--read-only` to strip write-capable toolsets (query/view/meta routing remain as configured). Use `--toolsets all` or an explicit list that **includes** the defaults you need (a custom list **replaces** the default set — e.g. `query,modify,meta,view,annotation`). Env: `BIMWRIGHT_DWG_TOOLSETS=…`.

`dwg_send_code` is available by default via `meta`; `MCPDISABLECODE` disables C# execution for the session and `MCPENABLECODE` re-enables it. `dwg_run_lisp` remains registered for compatibility but refuses every request at both server and plugin. This build has no isolated LISP executor or approved-script trust mechanism. `--read-only` removes both tools.

Activity toasts are on by default. Finished tool calls update one card in the AutoCAD window corner: success, failure and capture counts. The latest result is the counter tooltip. The card's left edge is a vertical gradient, and the footer shows `AutoCAD {year}`. Click the card to open an allowlisted capture from the latest result; the card then closes. The close button only closes the card and stays transparent on hover. The card hides after an idle interval (10, 20, 30 or 60 seconds, default 20) and pauses while the pointer is over it. While AutoCAD is minimized or a modal dialog is open, counts are kept and the card is shown once when the frame is usable again. Toggle with `MCPTOAST` or open `MCPSETTINGS`. `enableToast` and `toastIdleSeconds` are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\settings.json`. `BIMWRIGHT_ENABLE_TOAST=0` re-applies at every launch while set. Show branding is off until turned on in Settings and lasts only for the current AutoCAD session. Toasts never steal keyboard focus.

`dwg_send_code` accepts inline synchronous snippets only: `async`/`await` and `#load` directives are rejected before execution. Keep AutoCAD API calls on the calling thread; do not offload them to `Task.Run` or other threads. Return JSON-safe DTOs; AutoCAD/COM objects are rejected even when nested. LISP inspection is available through `dwg_inspect_lisp`: sources over 2,000,000 characters are reported uninspectable/dangerous, and the 200-finding display cap does not stop severity detection. Regex matching has a timeout; timed-out scans are reported as incomplete/dangerous, never clean.

---

## Tools

Default startup exposes 41 tools: query (including `dwg_inspect_lisp`), modify, meta (including `dwg_send_code`/`dwg_run_lisp`), view, and default-on `dwg_capture_view_image`. Optional ToolBaker, annotation, block, dimension, export, and drawing toolsets, enabled through `--toolsets`, bring the backed MCP surface to 65 tools. The registered counts include `dwg_run_lisp`, which only returns a refusal; no scan verdict authorizes execution.

General CAD tools operate on the current active document in the selected AutoCAD target. Entity inputs and returned entity IDs use AutoCAD hex handles, such as `7F5AD`, returned by selection, creation, or property tools. Creation, copy, offset, and modify responses identify generated or modified entities by hex handle.

Plan 2 query expansion is model-space only: `dwg_query_entities`, `dwg_count_entities`, `dwg_select_by_layer`, and `dwg_select_by_type` scan model space, not paper-space/layout entities. `dwg_select_by_layer` and `dwg_select_by_type` return handle lists for the caller; they do not change AutoCAD's pickfirst selection.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_get_drawing_info` | Read current drawing name, current layer, current space/layout, and unit scalars |
| `dwg_get_entity_properties` | Read properties for entities identified by AutoCAD hex handles |

| `dwg_query_entities` | Query model-space entities by optional type, layer, color, limit, and geometry flags |
| `dwg_count_entities` | Count model-space entities by optional type, layer, or color filters |
| `dwg_select_by_layer` | Return model-space entity handle lists for one layer without changing pickfirst selection |
| `dwg_select_by_type` | Return model-space entity handle lists for one entity type without changing pickfirst selection |

| `dwg_update_texts` | Write new text by handle in one transaction |
| `dwg_create_layer` | Ensure a layer exists without overwriting an existing layer's properties |
| `dwg_create_line` | Create one line in the current drawing space |
| `dwg_create_circle` | Create one circle in the current drawing space |
| `dwg_create_point` | Create one point and return its hex handle |
| `dwg_create_polyline` | Create a lightweight polyline from vertices and return its hex handle |
| `dwg_create_rectangle` | Create a rectangle polyline and return its hex handle |
| `dwg_create_arc` | Create one arc and return its hex handle |
| `dwg_create_ellipse` | Create one ellipse and return its hex handle |
| `dwg_change_layer` | Move entities identified by hex handles to another layer |
| `dwg_change_color` | Change entity color by AutoCAD color index |
| `dwg_move_entities` | Move entities identified by hex handles by a displacement vector |
| `dwg_rotate_entities` | Rotate entities identified by hex handles around a base point |
| `dwg_scale_entities` | Scale entities identified by hex handles around a base point |
| `dwg_copy_entities` | Copy entities identified by hex handles and return copied handles |
| `dwg_erase_entities` | Erase entities identified by hex handles |
| `dwg_offset_entities` | Offset curve entities and return generated handles |
| `dwg_translate_and_rewrite` | **Preferred.** Write translated text back: anchor, delete, MText, font, height |
| `dwg_apply_unicode_style` | Ensure `Bimwright_Unicode` style exists and apply to targets |
| `dwg_collapse_and_rewrite` | Low-level rewrite primitive with explicit geometric control |
| `dwg_list_available_targets` | List running AutoCAD targets discovered from v2 JSON and legacy 2024 discovery files |
| `dwg_get_current_target` | Show the pinned target year, if any |
| `dwg_switch_target` | Pin this server process to AutoCAD `2022` through `2027` |
| `dwg_batch_execute` | Run multiple internal wire commands as a logical batch |
| `dwg_send_code` | Execute a C# snippet against the AutoCAD .NET API (globals `doc`/`db`/`ed`, `return` value + captured stdout, cooperative 30s cancellation; `MCPDISABLECODE`/`MCPENABLECODE` toggle per session) |
| `dwg_run_lisp` | Compatibility endpoint only: all `file`/`code`/`command` inputs are refused with `lisp_execution_blocked`. No file read, plugin dispatch or execution from this tool. Use `dwg_inspect_lisp` for analysis only. |
| `dwg_inspect_lisp` | Static safety scan of a `.lsp` file or inline AutoLISP — flags process exec (`startapp`/`shell`), dangerous COM (`WScript.Shell`/`XMLHTTP`), persistence (`acaddoc.lsp`, registry writes), file deletion, staged `(load …)`, obfuscation (`eval`/`read`). Returns `verdict` clean/caution/dangerous + findings. Pure local analysis; no execution, no AutoCAD needed; available even under `--read-only`. `clean` does not certify safety. Reports include `execution_authorized=false` and `safety_assured=false`. |
| `dwg_zoom_extents` | Zoom to the extents of the drawing viewport |
| `dwg_zoom_window` | Zoom viewport to a window defined by two corner points |
| `dwg_zoom_to_entity` | Zoom viewport to the extents of a specific drawing entity identified by handle |
| `dwg_capture_view_image` | Capture drawing graphics inside AutoCAD; return inline image, path, actual size, hash, document/viewport/camera metadata (default-on; path policy applies) |
| `dwg_inspect_view_region` | Choose a normalized rectangle on a capture; zoom, regenerate and return a fresh inline image with parent linkage |
| `dwg_restore_view` | Return to an earlier capture's camera and obtain a fresh inline image |

Visual reading: capture → inspect the image → choose a region → `dwg_inspect_view_region` → inspect again. Keep ancestor IDs and use `dwg_restore_view` to return to the overview. Source history lasts 30 minutes / 64 captures in one AutoCAD process. Region navigation initially supports one top-down, unrotated, orthographic model-space viewport; unsupported or stale sources are refused. Capture responses now include an MCP image block (8 MiB limit) alongside the existing JSON text. These tools change the visible camera and save images, including under `--read-only`; they do not edit geometry or save DWG. Installed-host acceptance is pending. See [workflow, compatibility and acceptance](docs/design/2026-09-24-visual-reading-loop.md).

Optional ToolBaker tools are exposed when the `toolbaker` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_list_baked_tools` | List accepted baked tools from the server-owned SQLite registry |
| `dwg_run_baked_tool` | Run an accepted baked tool by name |
| `dwg_list_bake_suggestions` | List detected repeated-workflow suggestions |
| `dwg_accept_bake_suggestion` | Validate, smoke-test, and accept a suggestion |
| `dwg_dismiss_bake_suggestion` | Dismiss or suppress a suggestion |
| `dwg_create_bake_issue_draft` | Generate a GitHub issue draft for a suggestion without submitting it |

Optional Annotation tools are exposed when the `annotation` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_create_text` | Create single-line text (DBText) with target height, rotation, and properties |
| `dwg_create_mtext` | Create multi-line text (MText) with formatting and width |
| `dwg_create_leader` | Create a multileader (MLeader) with optional leader text |
| `dwg_create_table` | Create an AutoCAD table with specified row/column text contents |

Optional Block tools are exposed when the `block` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_list_blocks` | List block definitions in the current drawing (read-only safe) |
| `dwg_get_block_attributes` | Read attributes of a block reference by handle (read-only safe) |
| `dwg_insert_block` | Insert a block reference, optionally importing from an external DWG |
| `dwg_set_block_attributes` | Set attributes of a block reference by handle |
| `dwg_explode_block` | Explode a block reference and return the handles of generated parts |

Optional Dimension tools are exposed when the `dimension` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_create_linear_dimension` | Create a rotated linear dimension with rotation degrees |
| `dwg_create_aligned_dimension` | Create an aligned dimension between two points |
| `dwg_create_radial_dimension` | Create a radial dimension for a circle or arc |
| `dwg_create_diameter_dimension` | Create a diametric dimension for a circle or arc |

Optional Export tools are exposed when the `export` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_export_dxf` | Export the drawing to a DXF file (guarded by output path policy) |

Optional Drawing tools are exposed when the `drawing` toolset is enabled:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dwg_get_variables` | Read current values of drawing system variables |
| `dwg_set_system_variable` | Set the value of a drawing system variable |
| `dwg_save_drawing` | Save the current drawing to a file (requires confirm=true) |
| `dwg_purge_drawing` | Purge unused named objects (blocks, layers, styles) (supports dry_run=true, actual purge requires confirm=true) |

### Output Path Policy
All export operations are strictly guarded by a path policy that enforces:
- Output paths must be absolute.
- File extensions must match the specific tool (e.g., `.dxf` for DXF export).
- Existing files are not overwritten unless `overwrite_existing=true` is explicitly provided.
- Writing to the repository root directory is rejected unless `allow_repo_output=true` is set.

### Optional Toolsets and Read-Only Behavior

By default, only `query`, `modify`, `meta`, and `view` toolsets are enabled. You can opt-in to others using the `--toolsets` flag (e.g., `--toolsets all` or `--toolsets query,modify,meta,view,annotation,block,dimension,export,drawing`).

- **Read-Only Mode (`--read-only`)**: When read-only mode is active, all write-capable toolsets (`modify`, `code`, `annotation`, `dimension`, `export`, and `drawing` write tools) are completely disabled.
- **Block Toolset Split**: The `block` toolset is split into read-only and write-capable tools. If `--read-only` is active, `dwg_list_blocks` and `dwg_get_block_attributes` are still available (safe read inspection), but the mutation/creation tools (`dwg_insert_block`, `dwg_set_block_attributes`, `dwg_explode_block`) are stripped.
- **View and Read-Only**: The `view` toolset stays registered in read-only mode (zoom tools and `dwg_capture_view_image`). Capture is marked read-only at the MCP schema level but still writes an image file under the path policy — treat paths carefully under `--read-only`.
- **Drawing Operations and Read-Only**: The `drawing` toolset retains `dwg_get_variables` in read-only mode, but strips `dwg_set_system_variable`, `dwg_save_drawing`, and `dwg_purge_drawing`.
- **Deferred Angular Dimensions**: Note that only linear, aligned, radial, and diametric dimension types are currently supported. Angular dimensions are deferred and not yet implemented.
- **Native View Capture**: `dwg_capture_view_image` uses AutoCAD's `Document.CapturePreviewImage` API, with no desktop automation or DWG save. It rejects an active command or a document/camera change during capture. Optional `expected_document_fingerprint` binds a subsequent capture to a prior result. Save the returned metadata alongside the image for a reading atlas; the tool itself writes only the image. Native output dimensions may differ slightly from the requested size. Camera metadata describes the active viewport, not a universal pixel-to-world mapping for tiled views or paper layouts. See [capture contract and validation](docs/design/2026-09-23-native-view-capture.md).
- **Deferred File Export Tools**: `dwg_export_pdf` and `dwg_export_image` remain deferred; viewport capture does not configure or validate plotting.

### Manual smoke checklist

In a scratch DWG:

1. Run `dwg_get_drawing_info`.
2. Run `dwg_list_layers`.
3. Create `BIMWRIGHT_TEST` with `dwg_create_layer`.
4. Create a point, polyline, rectangle, arc, and ellipse on `BIMWRIGHT_TEST` with `dwg_create_point`, `dwg_create_polyline`, `dwg_create_rectangle`, `dwg_create_arc`, and `dwg_create_ellipse`; record the returned hex handles and reserve one curve, such as the arc or ellipse, for color and offset checks.
5. Query, count, and select those entities by layer and type with `dwg_query_entities`, `dwg_count_entities`, `dwg_select_by_layer`, and `dwg_select_by_type`; confirm select tools return handle lists and do not change pickfirst selection.
6. Move, rotate, and scale non-reserved scratch entities with `dwg_move_entities`, `dwg_rotate_entities`, and `dwg_scale_entities`.
7. Copy one non-reserved scratch entity with `dwg_copy_entities`, then erase only that disposable copied temp entity with `dwg_erase_entities`.
8. Change color on the reserved curve with `dwg_change_color`, then offset that curve with `dwg_offset_entities` and confirm the returned generated handles are hex handles.
9. Confirm the existing text translation workflow still works: select scratch text, run `dwg_get_selected_texts`, then rewrite it with `dwg_translate_and_rewrite`.

### Optional smoke — annotation / block / dimension

Enable the optional toolsets first (`--toolsets …` or `--toolsets all`). On a scratch DWG:

1. Create text, mtext, leader, and table in a scratch DWG with `dwg_create_text`, `dwg_create_mtext`, `dwg_create_leader`, and `dwg_create_table`.
2. List block definitions with `dwg_list_blocks`.
3. Insert a known block from the drawing or from an absolute external DWG path with `dwg_insert_block`.
4. Get and set block attributes with `dwg_get_block_attributes` and `dwg_set_block_attributes`.
5. Explode a block reference with `dwg_explode_block`.
6. Create linear, aligned, radial, and diameter dimensions with `dwg_create_linear_dimension`, `dwg_create_aligned_dimension`, `dwg_create_radial_dimension`, and `dwg_create_diameter_dimension`, confirming linear projected-distance validation succeeds/rejects as expected.

### Optional smoke — view / export / drawing

With `view`, `export`, and `drawing` toolsets enabled (as needed):

1. Run `dwg_zoom_extents`.
2. Run `dwg_zoom_window` with coordinates.
3. Zoom to an entity with `dwg_zoom_to_entity` using a recorded hex handle.
4. Read drawing variables with `dwg_get_variables`.
5. Export drawing to dxf with `dwg_export_dxf`.
6. Run `dwg_purge_drawing` with `dry_run=true`, then with `confirm=true` (on a copied/disposable DWG only).
7. Run `dwg_save_drawing` with `confirm=true` (on a copied/disposable DWG only).

### Migration from 0.1.x tool names

MCP tool names now use the `dwg_` prefix. Raw plugin command names remain internal wire commands.

| 0.1.x MCP name | 1.0 MCP name |
|----------------|--------------|
| `get_selected_texts` | `dwg_get_selected_texts` |
| `update_texts` | `dwg_update_texts` |
| `translate_and_rewrite` | `dwg_translate_and_rewrite` |
| `apply_unicode_style` | `dwg_apply_unicode_style` |
| `collapse_and_rewrite` | `dwg_collapse_and_rewrite` |
| `send_code` | `dwg_send_code` |
| `run_lisp` | `dwg_run_lisp` |

---

## Standard Workflow

```
1. User selects text entities in AutoCAD
2. Agent calls dwg_get_selected_texts -> receives clustered text groups
3. Agent translates each cluster
4. Agent calls dwg_translate_and_rewrite([{id, new_text}, ...])
   Tool handles: anchor, delete, MText, font style, height. Done.
5. User runs REGEN if needed
```

Two steps from the agent's perspective: read, then write.

## Supported AutoCAD Versions

| Version | ObjectARX release | Plugin TFM | Status |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| AutoCAD 2022 | 24.1 | `net48` | Shell scaffolded; release build requires local Autodesk refs |
| AutoCAD 2023 | 24.2 | `net48` | Shell scaffolded; release build requires local Autodesk refs |
| AutoCAD 2024 | 24.3 | `net48` | Default supported shell and normal solution build |
| AutoCAD 2025 | 25.0 | `net8.0-windows` | Shell scaffolded; release build requires local Autodesk refs |
| AutoCAD 2026 | 25.1 | `net8.0-windows` | Shell scaffolded; binary-compatible with 2025 but built as its own shell |
| AutoCAD 2027 | 26.0 | `net10.0-windows` | Shell scaffolded; not binary-compatible with 2025/2026 |

The server and tests can pass without every AutoCAD shell being release-built. Shipping an AutoCAD year requires building that shell on a prepared machine with the matching Autodesk managed assemblies.

---

## Security

`dwg_send_code` executes arbitrary C# with full access to AutoCAD and the local filesystem; it is for trusted agents, not a sandbox. `dwg_run_lisp` is blocked regardless of input, scanner verdict or `MCPENABLECODE`. No LISP wrapper is created or queued, and no trusted path or SECURELOAD setting is changed. Do not bypass a LISP refusal through C#, batch or ToolBaker. `dwg_inspect_lisp` is static triage, not antivirus or machine-wide malware protection; `clean` means no known pattern matched, not safe. All reports set `execution_authorized=false` and `safety_assured=false`. Update both server and plugin and restart their processes to apply the restriction; old binaries retain their old behavior.

The security model relies on:

- **Local-only transport** — TCP on 127.0.0.1 for AutoCAD 2022–2024, loopback Named Pipe for 2025–2027, no remote access.
- **Per-session auth token** — rotates on each plugin start, verified per request.
- **Session kill-switch** — `MCPDISABLECODE` / `MCPENABLECODE` control `dwg_send_code`. LISP remains blocked even after enabling code or restarting the listener.
- **Timeout boundary** — script execution runs inline on the document-lock thread with cooperative 30s cancellation.
- **Trusted agent assumption** — only use with MCP clients you control.

Do not expose the plugin port to the network.
