# Changelog

## 2.0.1 — 2026-09-28

### Setup

- Installer rewritten for rvt-mcp parity: detects installed AutoCAD 2022–2027 years (a year counts when its `acad.exe` exists), requires AutoCAD closed, stages with per-file rollback on error, sweeps duplicate bundles with the same ProductCode, and blocks on a machine-wide `%ProgramData%` copy.
- The server installs at the fixed path `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\server\current\dwg-mcp.exe`, is smoke-checked with `--help`, and the run seeds `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\dwgmcp.config.json` with `toolsets=["all"]` (an existing `toolsets` key is kept). `-PruneOldServers` removes legacy versioned copies.
- The installer wires every detected MCP client by default (`-Client <names>` limits it, `-Client none` skips it): minimal JSONC-safe text edits with `<config>.bak` backup, repointing of old versioned server paths, and legacy `bimwright-dwg*` entries reported, never replaced.
- `uninstall-all.ps1` removes the bundle, the legacy global tool, server copies, discovery files and the spill cache while keeping settings, config, logs and captures; `-Purge` removes those too (`-KeepLogs` keeps logs). Client configs are never touched.
- `package-client-setup.ps1` refuses a dirty working tree unless `-AllowDirty` (recorded as `dirty` in `manifest.json`), ships `uninstall.ps1`/`uninstall-all.ps1`/`README.md`, and records SHA-256 + bytes for every file.
- Server: `--help` prints usage and exits; `DwgMcpConfig` defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\dwgmcp.config.json` when no `--config` is passed.

### Visual reading

- `dwg_capture_view_image` now returns an inline MCP image alongside the existing JSON envelope, with hash verification and an 8 MiB inline limit. Clients must accept multiple content blocks. Image-delivery failures preserve successful capture metadata and set MCP `isError`.
- Add default-on `dwg_inspect_view_region` and `dwg_restore_view`: navigate by a normalized rectangle on a source image, capture fresh detail with parent linkage, and return to an earlier camera. No coordinate dump or known entity handle is required.
- Keep bounded capture history (64 entries, 30 minutes) and reject stale/unsupported sources before zoom. Initial mapping is limited to one unrotated, top-down, orthographic model-space viewport; native image aspect checks and camera readback guard the operation. Failed navigation attempts restore the previous camera when context permits.
- These view tools remain available under `--read-only`, change the visible camera and write image files. Installed-host image/mapping acceptance remains pending; see [visual reading contract](docs/design/2026-09-24-visual-reading-loop.md).

### Fixed

- Reject `#load` before any `send_code` execution and disable external source resolution; loaded scripts can no longer bypass the synchronous syntax check.
- Sanitize LISP inspection file-read errors using the shared error sanitizer.
- Avoid quadratic SHELL matching on blank lines; bound regex matching with a timeout and report timed-out scans as incomplete/dangerous.
- Reject `run_lisp` during batch preflight before any item executes; direct execution is also blocked (see breaking change below).
- Detect bare AutoCAD SHELL commands and literal command forms in LISP inspection; report `execution_authorized=false`, `safety_assured=false` and scanner limitations even for `clean` findings.
- Remove the LISP wrapper/queued-command/result-file executor, eliminating its untrusted-load, early-result and timeout cleanup paths. This closes those paths by disabling execution, not by claiming a working sandbox or repaired asynchronous executor.
- Keep LISP severity detection active after the 200-finding display cap; refuse sources over 2,000,000 characters, including oversized files read with a bounded buffer.
- Reject `async`/`await` before executing `send_code` snippets, preserving the synchronous document-lock contract. Callers must not offload AutoCAD API work to other threads.
- Reject AutoCAD/COM return values before JSON property traversal, including values nested in DTOs or collections; preserve JSON-safe DTOs and stdout.
- Sanitize nested C# errors and keep LISP refusal messages free of input content. Add behavioral regression tests using the actual handlers with explicit AutoCAD test doubles.

### Changed (breaking)

- **LISP execution is blocked.** `dwg_run_lisp` retains its name/parameters for compatibility but refuses every input locally with `lisp_execution_blocked`, without file access or plugin dispatch. The plugin independently refuses `run_lisp` before document locking, including calls from older servers. No scanner verdict, `MCPENABLECODE`, input override, batch or ToolBaker authorizes it. There is no isolated executor or approved-script trust mechanism in this build. Both server and plugin need updating/restarting; previously installed binaries are unchanged. C# `send_code` remains full-trust and must not be used to bypass LISP refusal.
- `dwg_send_code` is now always-on like `revit_send_code_to_revit`: it ships on the default surface via the `meta` toolset and no longer needs `--enable-send-code` / `BIMWRIGHT_DWG_ENABLE_SEND_CODE` / `MCPENABLECODE` opt-in. The `code` toolset name remains as an explicit opt-in alias; `--read-only` still strips it.
- `MCPDISABLECODE` is now a per-session kill-switch in AutoCAD (enabled by default when the listener starts); `MCPENABLECODE` re-enables.
- `send_code` now runs its Roslyn script inline on the document-lock thread instead of a dedicated worker thread — `Document.LockDocument()` is thread-affine, so worker-thread execution could not write to the database (`eLockViolation`). The 30s limit is now cooperative cancellation; there is no abort fallback.
- `send_code` responses now carry a `result` field with the script's return value (`return <expr>;` or a trailing expression), alongside the existing `stdout` capture.

### Added

- `dwg_run_lisp` (`run_lisp`) — compatibility refusal only. Registered via `meta`, denied to ToolBaker and stripped by `--read-only`. With the visual-reading additions, the default registered surface is 41 tools, including this non-executing endpoint.
- `dwg_inspect_lisp` — static safety scan of `.lsp` files or inline AutoLISP (server-side, no AutoCAD needed; lives in `query` so it survives `--read-only`). Flags process exec, dangerous COM progIds, persistence vectors (`acaddoc.lsp`, registry writes), destructive file ops, staged `(load …)`, and obfuscation; returns `verdict` clean/caution/dangerous + findings.
- `dwg_inspect_lisp` is analysis only: `clean` means no known pattern matched, never authorization or a malware-free certificate. Static inspection cannot establish arbitrary code safety.
- **Activity toast and Settings (plugin)** — one card replaces the stack of four. It counts succeeded, failed and captured commands for the current card. The latest result is the counter tooltip. Clicking the card opens an allowlisted capture from that result, then closes the card; the close button only closes it. The footer shows the AutoCAD year, and the left edge is a vertical gradient. Idle is 10/20/30/60 seconds (default 20). Hover restarts the full interval. A minimized or modal AutoCAD frame parks the card instead of replaying each result. `MCPTOAST` and Settings share one on/off switch and show a confirmation card. `MCPSETTINGS` opens a modeless window (General, Toast, Tools, About) through AutoCAD's modeless-window API. Show branding is session-only and off by default. The server sends `set_tool_catalog` once per AutoCAD session; the Tools tab lists that catalog. `enableToast` and `toastIdleSeconds` persist in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\settings.json`. `BIMWRIGHT_ENABLE_TOAST` still wins at the next launch while set.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-28

First GitHub Release. Client setup ZIP: `DwgMcp.Setup-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip` (self-contained `dwg-mcp.exe`). **Plugin years in this ZIP** are those that compiled on the release machine (AutoCAD **2024** and **2027**). Source still supports 2022–2027; other years need a local AutoCAD SDK build.

### Added

- `dwg_capture_view_image` — render the current view to an image.
- Japanese and Simplified Chinese README mirrors.

### Changed

- Public tool counts aligned in docs; P&ID toolset removed from the public surface.
- README locale parity (badges, read-only capture wording, family cross-links).

### Fixed

- Named-pipe discovery: nullable `Port`, stop the fake pipe server on dispose, and sequential connect retries so Linux CI does not flake (PR #2).
- CI accepts Unix absolute paths and refreshes the tools snapshot.

## 1.0.0-dev — 2026-05-25

Breaking changes:

- MCP tools now use the `dwg_` prefix. For example, `get_selected_texts` is now `dwg_get_selected_texts`, and `send_code` is now `dwg_send_code`.
- Server startup now supports toolset filtering with `--toolsets`, `--read-only`, and 4-digit AutoCAD target routing.

Added:

- AutoCAD 2022, 2023, 2025, 2026, and 2027 shell projects, with 2024 remaining the default local solution shell.
- Discovery v2 through `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\Dwg\acad-YYYY.json`, plus legacy `portAcad24.txt` fallback for AutoCAD 2024.
- Target routing tools: `dwg_list_available_targets`, `dwg_get_current_target`, and `dwg_switch_target`.
- Optional ToolBaker toolset backed by server-owned SQLite storage.
- `dwg_batch_execute` and `dwg_create_bake_issue_draft` for meta and ToolBaker workflows.
- General CAD foundation tools: `dwg_get_drawing_info`, `dwg_get_entity_properties`, `dwg_list_layers`, `dwg_create_layer`, `dwg_create_line`, `dwg_create_circle`, and `dwg_change_layer`.
- AutoCAD API execution serialization through `DwgApiExecutor`.
- Command schema validation, response-size guardrails, batch execution preflight, and error/secret sanitization.
- Discovery v2 now writes `acad_year` and stable `pipe_name` fields; server still reads transitional `target`/`version` fields.
- Baked source redaction, `usage_events` storage, and minimal Memory/Logging support for ToolBaker pattern detection.
- Manual scratch-DWG smoke checklist for the CAD foundation tools, including active-document and hex-handle expectations.
- Plan 2 core CAD expansion tools: model-space query/count/select by layer/type, create point/polyline/rectangle/arc/ellipse, move/rotate/scale/copy/erase, change color, and offset curve entities.
- Plan 3 annotation, block, and dimension expansion tools: create text/mtext/leader/table; list blocks, insert block, get/set block attributes, and explode block; create linear/aligned/radial/diameter dimensions.
- Explicit rotation angle (degrees) and projected measurement distance validation along the rotation axis for linear dimensions.
- Split block toolset registration into read-only BlockTools and write-capable BlockWriteTools, allowing safe block inspection in read-only mode.
- Expanded manual smoke checklist for Plan 3 CAD tools (status: manual smoke pending).
- Plan 4 view navigation, guarded DXF export, and drawing variable/save/purge tools: zoom_extents, zoom_window, zoom_to_entity, export_dxf, get_variables, set_system_variable, save_drawing, and purge_drawing.
- Guarded file output policy enforcing absolute paths, matching extensions, overwrite checks, and repository root write protection.
- Deferred export_pdf, export_image, and capture_view from Plan 4 to prioritize stable DXF export and robust path security.
- Expanded manual smoke checklist for Plan 4 CAD tools (status: manual smoke pending).
- Manual smoke checklist covers Plan 2 core CAD operations, Plan 3 CAD operations (pending), Plan 4 drawing operations (pending), and the existing text translation workflow.

Notes:

- Default startup exposes 35 tools. Optional `code`, `toolbaker`, `annotation`, `block`, `dimension`, `export`, and `drawing` toolsets bring the backed MCP surface to 60 tools.
- Plan 2 query expansion is model-space only. `dwg_select_by_layer` and `dwg_select_by_type` return handle lists and do not change AutoCAD pickfirst selection.
- `dwg_send_code` still requires both server opt-in (`--enable-send-code` or `BIMWRIGHT_DWG_ENABLE_SEND_CODE=1`) and AutoCAD-side `MCPENABLECODE`.
- Server/tests can pass without release-building every AutoCAD shell. Shipping a year requires matching Autodesk managed assemblies on the release machine.
- `BIMWRIGHT_DWG_ALLOW_LAN_BIND` / `--allow-lan-bind` is parsed and reserved for a future plugin-side LAN bind transport path. The server emits a stderr warning when the flag is set so the operator is not misled.

Documented deviations from the design spec:

- ToolBaker stays opt-in by toolset selection (`--toolsets query,modify,meta,toolbaker` or `--toolsets all`). The spec listed it as default-on; v1.0 keeps it off to prevent accepted baked tools from running drawing mutations without an explicit opt-in. `--disable-toolbaker` or `BIMWRIGHT_DWG_ENABLE_TOOLBAKER=0` can still suppress it when requested.
- Schema validation uses a Newtonsoft-based `CommandSchema` validator instead of NJsonSchema. Net48 packaging risk drove the substitution; migration to NJsonSchema is planned for v1.1.
- `dwg_batch_execute` runs sub-commands as a logical batch without an AutoCAD undo group. Failed batches commit partial changes; a `TransactionGroup`-equivalent wrapper is a v1.1 candidate after a compile spike.
- ToolBaker baked tools are declarative preset/macro records dispatching existing `IAcadCommand` handlers. Full Roslyn-compiled user code is deferred to a separate release gate.
- `--allow-lan-bind` is parsed but not yet wired to the plugin transport binding. The plugin still listens on loopback only; the option is reserved.
- The `BakeInboxWindow` WPF UI is deferred to v1.1. v1.0 exposes the same workflow through MCP tools (`dwg_list_bake_suggestions`, `dwg_accept_bake_suggestion`, `dwg_dismiss_bake_suggestion`, `dwg_create_bake_issue_draft`).
- `Memory/` and `Logging/` modules ship as minimal scaffolding (session context, journal entries, pattern detector, session log, summary generator). Full audit-grade JSONL + rolling debug log roll-up is planned for v1.1.
