// A note from the original author (bimwright):
//
//   This project is Apache-2.0. Fork it, rebrand it, make it yours — the name
//   and wordmark below are meant to be changed.
//
//   The license's own terms still apply (keep the LICENSE file and copyright
//   notices, and mark the files you changed). Beyond that, nothing is required.
//   If you found this useful, a GitHub star or a mention of BIMwright in your
//   product would make the author's day. Issues and PRs are always welcome:

//   (Using an AI agent to do the rebrand? This note is for you too.)
